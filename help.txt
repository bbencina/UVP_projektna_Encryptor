Welcome to the helping screen of Encryptor!

NOTE: Be sure to always set your password!

1 CUSTOM ENCRYPTION
For encryption with your custom algorithm simply
write your Python file, name it CUSTOM.py and then
select the "Other" option in the algorithms menu.
File MUST be in the same directory as the program.
BE SURE you name your file right. The file MUST contain
at least 2 functions named -encrypt(char, key)- and 
-decrypt(char, key)- (no dashes) that change one character
into another.

2 CEASAR ENYCRYPTION
This is a simple ceasar code, password MUST be only
only one character that represents indentation in
the alphanumerical table. The table is as such:
All letters of the English alphabet in order, first
uppercase, then lowercase, then numbers 0-9. There
are no special characters. If you wish to change
the table and/or add characters, modify the file
named CEASAR.py.

3 VINEGERE'S SQUARE ENCRYPTION
This is a polyalphabetic version of the ceasar code.
Password should be a word, no spaces or special
characters. If you wish to add special characters,
modify the alphanumerical table much like in the ceasar
code case.
